# My cookery book 2 - backend (PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!!)
Backend application providing RestApi build on Express and Node.js. Whole backend is writen in Typescript.

## Technologies required for development
* Node.js (>=18)
* Docker (>=20.10.14)
* Docker compose (>=2.10.2)

## Development
While development it is required to have Postgres database running. It can be runned by prepared `docker-compose.yaml` file. This development environment can be started by command:
* `docker compose up -d` 

It will run pgAdmin on port 8081 and database on port 5432.

After database is running, you can start development server by commands:
* `npm install` (only if you didn't run it before or you modifed package.json file)
* `npm run start:dev`

It will run node.js app on port 8080. It will use environment variables defined inside `.env` file where you can optionaly modify port, basepath etc. If you modified docker-compose.yaml you need modify accordingly this file too to ensure correct configuration of database.

When you are done with development, don't forget to stop database server by running command:
* `docker compose down`
